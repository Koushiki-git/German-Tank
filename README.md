This code simulates the **German Tank Problem**, a statistical method used to estimate the total number of distinct items (in this case, tanks) based on a small random sample. The program starts by generating a list of numbers from 1 to 100, representing the population. It then randomly selects a sample of `k = 13` elements with repetition, meaning some numbers can be chosen more than once. For each sample, the **German Tank Estimator** is applied, which estimates the total population size based on the maximum value in the sample and the number of distinct values in the sample. The estimation formula is derived from the idea that, in random sampling, the largest value observed is close to the actual maximum. The program repeats this process 1000 times, averaging the results to get a more accurate estimate of the population size. Finally, it prints the average estimate, which approximates the total population of 100 based on the repeated sampling.
